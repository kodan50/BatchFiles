# BatchFiles2
Okay, so like I created a new repo and it wouldn't let me get started with adding batch scripts, so I tried to import a very simple repo to get started and everything stopped working. I can't seem to figure out how to delete a broken repo (Thanks GitHub) so now I have a second repo and just ignore the first one.
here I plan to upload batch snips I use to do stuff. Enjoy! Or don't, I don't care anymore.

*Found out how to delete and rename a repo! Yay! Am I a dev yet?

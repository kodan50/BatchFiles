# BatchFiles
I've collected several batch scripts over the years. I am uploading them here for future reference. Bonus if you find any of these useful in some way.
Do not use the "Block windows update" as it no longer seems to work. Probably because it was useful and M$ doesn't like useful things. Maybe it just needs a syntax change. I don't know. I don't care. Just don't use it. Or do, I'm not your dad.
